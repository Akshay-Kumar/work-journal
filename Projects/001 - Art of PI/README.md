## Description
Inspired by [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/14/10-stunning-images-show-the-beauty-hidden-in-pi/) article, with some help from [Alca](https://codepen.io/Alca) (regarding some p5 functionality) I've tried to replicate the bellow behavior using p5js's bezier function to connect 1000 digits of PI.

## Possible adjustments for the future
1. Add numbers around the circle to corresponding digits of pi
2. Leave a blank circle in the middle as in the image above
