## Description
Steering behaving on an image's grouped color pixels. Idea from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4) video.

**Try moving your mouse around the image circles!** ^_^

## Link
You can see the version live on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/VXayby).

## Possible adjustments for the future
1. Refactor sketch.js to work directly with the pixels array
2. Add upload image functionality
